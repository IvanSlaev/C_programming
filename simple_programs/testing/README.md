TESTING IMPLEMENTATION

We are goint to implement google C++ testing framework for creating a 
simple C++ unit test for a simple C program. 
Note that you must download the sourcecode of googletest by:
$ git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git

Don't forteg to change the path in GTEST_DIR variable in Makefile

Compilation is completed successfully and the sample1.c C program is
tested whit Google C++ unit test framework: GoogleTest.
Note that the small program "sample1.c" is compiled with C++ compiler in order to
obtain an object file "sample1.o" which can be used in unit test compilation.
